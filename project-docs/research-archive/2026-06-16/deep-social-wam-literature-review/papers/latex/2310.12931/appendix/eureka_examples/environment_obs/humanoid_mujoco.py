    ### Observation Space

    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,
     followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the
     positions ordered before all the velocities.

    Byy default, the observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(376,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
    the observation contains (in order):
    - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of mass
    (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10 (*nbody * 10*)
    and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
    - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence
    adds another 84 elements in the state space
    - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has shape
    `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state space.
    - *cfrc_ext:* This is the center of mass based external force on the body.  It has shape
    14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 84 elements in the state space.
    where *nbody* stands for the number of bodies in the robot and *nv* stands for the
    number of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*)

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions.

    Note that the obs argument passed to the reward function is a concatenation of obs across all environments, so it will have shape (n, 376).
